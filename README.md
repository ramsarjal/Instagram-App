We've done some work on design decisions.
We simplified the state management process.
Now you can easily make a snapshot of account state, save it in a persistent storage and then restore a 1-to-1 copy with just 1 function call.
With new realtime features you can listen for new direct messages, notifications and any other events.

The new version is hosted in private repository. Access is paid.
Members get **basic** support for installation, configuration, and usage.
We also will try to react on your feature requests.
